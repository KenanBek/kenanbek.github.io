Just pushed [Aiflowly](https://aiflowly.com) v0.20.0 with support for the latest AI models. Here's what's new.

## New Models

**OpenAI:**
- GPT-4.5 Preview
- GPT-o3 mini
- GPT-o1

**Anthropic:**
- Claude Sonnet 4
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet

**Google Gemini:**
- Gemini 2.0 Flash
- Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite

## Model Selection by Provider

I also updated the model selection UI to group models by provider. Previously all models were in a flat list which was getting messy with so many options. Now it's easier to find the model you want.

## Other Changes

- Cleaned up some unused code in the agents page
- Minor layout fixes in the sidebar and footer

You can try the new models in the [chat interface](https://aiflowly.com/chat) or use them when building workflows in the [flow builder](https://aiflowly.com/builder).
