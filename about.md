My name is Kanan Rahimov (aka KenanBek). I am a software engineer with over 16 years of experience designing, building, and delivering software systems.

Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at [Mollie](https://www.mollie.com/), focusing on Transaction Orchestration for 3DS Payments Flow. I specialize in payment processing APIs, including routing, transaction orchestration, PCI DSS compliance, card services, and tokenization.

I have developed applications in various domains, including payments, telecommunications, ride-hailing (pricing systems), and air navigation. My primary tech stack includes Java, Python, and Go.

As a hobby, I run a small indie software company [AppBaza.com](https://appbaza.com), building cross-platform applications, workflow management solutions, and AI integrations. Some of my projects include:

- [Dev Kit for AI](https://devkit4ai.com) - Multi-tenant SaaS platform for building and deploying AI-powered applications
- [Aiflowly](https://aiflowly.com) - Visual AI Agent Builder and Chat UI for ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini
- [maxDEV](https://maxdevapp.com/) - A cross-platform developer productivity application with ready-to-use dev tools

I live and work in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
