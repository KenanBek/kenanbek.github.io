My name is Kanan Rahimov (aka KenanBek) and I am Golang Software Engineer. Currently working as Software Engineering Manager at [Beat](https://www.linkedin.com/company/thebeatapp/). Interested in Go, Distributed Systems, and Open Source. Additionally, I like learning more about Rust, Flutter, and React Native. Previously I more than 5+ with Python and another 5 years as a C# .NET developer.
