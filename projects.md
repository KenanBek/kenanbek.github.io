### CoderVlogger

CoderVlogger is my YouTube channel where I post videos about software engineering. Initially, I started it to improve my speaking and presenting skills, especially in English.

Since my first video, the channel has grown, and I have tried multiple formats. At the moment, I am more interested in live coding sessions working with technologies like Go, Open-Source, Kubernetes, React Native, Flutter, and Next.js.

As you can see, there is a pretty broad range of technologies. So basically, my channel now reflects my current interest in software engineering. And that's what keeps it going.

Check [YouTube](https://youtube.com/codervlogger) and [Website](https://www.codervlogger.com/).

### CodeKN.com

CodeKN started as an experiment to learn more about Kubernetes, Golang, and distributed systems. Now, it contains a website and backend system. BE is responsible for fetching web pages, parsing them, and categorizing them. I also had a chance to try a very simple Machine Learning model to identify the article's topic. Everything runs on managed Kubernetes. I use MySQL as persistent storage.

The website is out of service now, but you can check some of my coding sessions recorded for this project [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7SBHyoMJ3Y&list=PLxa49UnOmIzqo9FJFweZdzlft10-OkiDt) if you are interested.
